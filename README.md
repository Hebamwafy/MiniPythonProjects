## MiniPythonProjects

Collection of small, fun Python projects I built to sharpen my programming skills and explore different concepts.

---

### Included Projects

* **Guess the Number Game** – Interactive CLI game where the program picks a number and prompts the user to guess until correct.
* **Rock, Paper, Scissors** – Classic game simulation with user vs. computer gameplay logic.
* **Text Editor** – A simple GUI or CLI-based text editor to practice file input/output and basic UI.
* **To-Do List** – Command-line to-do application (add, remove, view tasks).
* **Weather App** – Fetches and displays real-time weather using an API integration.
* **Website Scraper** – Extracts data (e.g., titles, links) from websites—hands-on web scraping.
* **Currency Converter** – Converts between currencies using live exchange rates from an external service.

### Technologies & Skills

* **Language:** Python (core language for all projects)
* **Key Concepts:**

  * CLI & GUI handling
  * Control flow & game logic
  * File read/write operations
  * API consumption & JSON parsing
  * Web scraping with libraries like `BeautifulSoup` or `requests`

### Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Hebamwafy/MiniPythonProjects.git
   cd MiniPythonProjects
   ```

2. **Create a virtual environment (recommended):**

   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install dependencies:**

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Run any project:**

   ```bash
   python guess_the_number.py
   ```

### What You’ll Learn

* Structuring Python projects and organizing files
* Building interactive scripts and basic gameplay logic
* Handling file operations (reading and writing)
* Consuming APIs for real-time data (weather, currency conversion)
* Scraping and parsing web content for automation

---

### Next Steps & Enhancements

* Add **GUI support** using frameworks like Tkinter or PyQt.
* Implement **unit tests** to ensure reliability.
* Introduce frameworks like `argparse` for handling command-line options.
* Wrap each project into standalone scripts or packages for easy reuse.
